					<h2 className="font-poppins font-[600]">Resolving Disputes</h2>
					<p className="font-p my-3 font-poppins">
						Let's Try To Sort Things Out First. We want to address your concerns
						without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against
						Securefastfunding or our affiliates, you agree to try to resolve the
						dispute informally by contacting office@Securefastfunding .com. We
						will try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via
						email.
					</p>
					<p className="font-p my-3 font-poppins">
						Judicial forum for disputes. You and Securefastfunding agree that
						any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or
						the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of
						Texas, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both
						you and Securefastfunding consent to venue and personal jurisdiction
						in such courts.

					<p className="font-p my-3 font-poppins">
						We Both Agree To Arbitrate. You and Securefastfunding agree to
						resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through
						final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator. This includes
						disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application
						of this â€œMandatory Arbitration Provisionsâ€ section, including its
						enforceability, revocability, or validity.
					</p>
					<p className="font-p my-3 font-poppins">
						Arbitration Procedures. The American Arbitration Association (AAA)
						will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration
						Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related
						Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States county
						where you live or work, Texas, or any other location we agree to.

					<p className="font-p my-3 font-poppins">
						These Terms will be governed by California law except for its
						conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries (including
						those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be
						governed by the local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph
						does not override those laws.
					</p>
					<h2 className="font-poppins font-[600]">Entire Agreement</h2>
					<p className="font-p my-3 font-poppins">
						These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and
						Securefastfunding with respect to the subject matter of these Terms
						and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous
						agreements or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter
						of these Terms. These Terms create no third-party beneficiary
						rights.

					<h2 className="font-poppins font-[600]">
						Revised Waiver, Severability & Assignment Terms
					</h2>
					<p className="font-p my-3 font-poppins">
						At Securefastfunding , failure to enforce a particular provision
						does not mean that we waive our right to enforce it later. If a
						provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining terms of the
						agreement will continue to remain in effect, and we will substitute
						the unenforceable provision with one that reflects our intentions as
						closely as possible. Please note that you cannot assign any of your
						rights under these Terms, and any attempt to do so will be
						considered invalid. However, we reserve the right to assign our
						rights to any affiliates, subsidiaries, or any successor in interest
						of any business associated with the Services.

						users, which may require us to revise these Terms from time to time.
						Such revisions may be made to reflect changes in the law, new
						regulatory requirements, or improvements and enhancements made to
						our Services. If any modification affects your use of the Services
						or your legal rights, we will notify you before the effective date
						of the update. We will send you an email to the email address
